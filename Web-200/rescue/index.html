                    Welcome to Wild Rescues. Our mission is to rescue, rehabilitate, and 
                    release wildlife back into their natural environment. We are a nonprofit 
                    organization dedicated to helping injured wildlife.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    Our staff provides around-the-clock care for wildlife in need. We also provide 
                    long-term care for wildlife that cannot be released back into their natural 
                    environment.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    Will you partner with us? We need caring volunteers to help care for our animals. 
                    You can also donate, become a member, or become a sponsor. Contact us today.
