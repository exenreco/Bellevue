Assignment 2.3 - Creating a Webpage for a Wildlife Rescue

Welcome to "Assignment 2.3 - Creating a Webpage for a Wildlife Rescue."

For this week's assignment, you will be experimenting with HTML templates.  
Also, the course textbook has a fun exercise at the end of this week's fitness 
website where the author demonstrates how to troubleshoot errors in an HTML page.  
I strongly encourage you to go follow along as the author troubleshoots simulated HTML errors.

Required Actions:
    - Create a new folder and add it to your web-200 directory.  Name the folder rescue.  

    - Using what you learned from this week's reading assignment, complete "Lab 2 Creating a 
    Webpage for a Wildlife Rescue."  Save your work in the rescue folder.  All of the work 
    you complete in this course for the rescue website will be saved in this folder.
