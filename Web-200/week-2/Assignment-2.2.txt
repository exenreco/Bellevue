Welcome to "Assignment 2.2 - GitHub Forks."  As a Web Developer, 
your personal projects are going to be more interesting than your 
professional ones.  This is because they reflect you, your ideas, 
your organizational skills, and your interests.  While we wonâ€™t be

coded projects on GitHub.  For part two (2), search GitHub for a repository that you 
find useful and fork it.  To do this, use this guide.
